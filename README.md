# Playground — Even/Odd Checker

Simple static page that checks whether a number is even or odd.

How to run

1. Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or if you prefer a dev server:

```
npm install   # optional, not required for the npx start command
npm start
```

This will run `npx live-server` and open `index.html` on http://127.0.0.1:3000.

Notes

- The app uses plain JavaScript and DOM APIs (no React or build step).
- If you want this converted into a React app (create-react-app / Vite), say so and I can scaffold it.
